# J-01 Alps PCB

This is an Alps compatible PCB for the [J-01 keyboard](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=107597).

While it lacks support for MX switches, it has Alps switch support and the following additional features:
- Full bottom row support per the options in Via (see the following [Keyboard Layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/1aa1c3e0d55bc183d22bc74a1a26bc83) for more information).
- Normal, split, and 3800-style Capslock footprints.
- Hand-solderable SMT component support, including the ATmega32U4-AU, instead of the smaller -MU variant.
